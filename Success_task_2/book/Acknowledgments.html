      <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
          <p>As with any book, what's written here has a great deal to do with the many people who have worked with me in various ways over the years. Lots of people have helped in
             lots of ways. Often I don't recall important things people said that went into this book, but I can acknowledge those contributions I do remember.</p>
          <p>I'll start with my contributors. David Rice, a colleague of mine at ThoughtWorks, has made a huge contribution â€” a good tenth of the book. As we worked hard
            to hit the deadline (while he was also supporting a client), we had several late-night instant message conversations where he confessed to finally seeing
            why writing a book is both so hard and so compulsive.</p>
          <p>Matt Foemmel is another ThoughtWorker, and although the Arctic will need air conditioning before he writes prose for fun, he's been a great contributor of 
             code examples (as well as a very succinct critic of the book.) I was pleased that Randy Stafford contributed <i>Service Layer</i> (133) as he's been such a strong
             advocate for it. I'd also like to thank Edward Hieatt and Rob Mee for their contribution, which arose from Rob's noticing a gap while he was doing his review
             of the text. He became my favorite reviewer: Not only does he notice something missing, he helps write a section to fix it!</p>
          <p>As usual, I owe more than I can say to my first-class panel of official reviewers:</p>
      <table>
          <tr>
              <td>John Brewer</td>
              <td>Rob Mee</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
              <td>Kyle Brown</td>
              <td>Gerard Meszarios</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
              <td>Jens Coldewey</td>
              <td> Dirk Riehle</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
              <td>John Crupi</td>
              <td>Randy Stafford</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
              <td>Leonard Fenster</td>
              <td> David Siegel</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
              <td>Alan Knight</td>
              <td> Kai Yu</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
        <p>I could almost list the ThoughtWorks telephone directory here, for so many of my colleagues have helped this project by talking over their designs
        and experiences with me. Many patterns formed in my mind because I had the opportunity to talk with the many talented designers we have, so I have 
        little choice but to thank the whole company.</p>
        <p>Kyle Brown, Rachel Reinitz, and Bobby Woolf have gone out of their way to have long and detailed review sessions with me in North Carolina. Their 
        fine-tooth comb has injected all sorts of wisdom, not including this particularly heinous mixed metaphor. In particular I've enjoyed several long
        telephone calls with Kyle that contributed more than I can list.</p>
        <p>Early in 2000 I prepared a talk for Java One with Alan Knight and Kai Yu that was the earliest genesis of this material. As well as thanking them
        for their help in that, I should also thank Josh Mackenzie, Rebecca Parsons, and Dave Rice for helping me refine these talks, and the ideas, later on. Jim
        Newkirk did a great deal in helping me get used to the new world of .NET.</p>
        <p>I've learned a lot from the many people working in this field with whom I've had good conversations and collaborations. In particular I'd like to thank
        Colleen Roe, David Muirhead, and Randy Stafford for sharing their work on the Foodsmart example system at Gemstone. I've also had great conversations
        at the Crested Butte workshop that Bruce Eckel has hosted and must thank all the people who attended that event in the last couple of years. Joshua 
        Kerievsky didn't have time to do a full review, but he was an excellent patterns consultant.</p>
        <p>As usual, I had the remarkable help of the UIUC reading group with their unique brand of no-holds-barred audio reviews. My thanks to: Ariel 
        Gertzenstein, Bosko Zivaljevic , Brad Jones, Brian Foote, Brian Marick, Federico Balaguer, Joseph Yoder, John Brant, Mike Hewner, Ralph Johnson, 
        and Weerasak Witthawaskul.</p>
        <p>Dragos Manolescu, an ex-UIUC hitman, got his own group together to give me feedback. My thanks to Muhammad Anan, Brian Doyle, Emad Ghosheh, Glenn Graessle,
        Daniel Hein, Prabhaharan Kumarakulasingam, Joe Quint, John Reinke, Kevin Reynolds, Sripriya Srinivasan, and Tirumala Vaddiraju.
        Kent Beck has given me more good ideas than I can remember. But I do remember that he came up with the name for Special Case (496). Jim Odell was
        responsible for getting me into the world of consulting, teaching, and writing - no acknowledgment will ever do his help justice.</p>
        <p>As I was writing this book, I put drafts on the Web. During this time many people sent me e-mails pointing out problems, asking questions, or 
        talking about alternatives. These people include Michael Banks, Mark Bernstein, Graham Berrisford, Bjorn Beskow, Bryan Boreham, Sean Broadley, Peris
        Brodsky, Paul Campbell, Chester Chen, John Coakley, Bob Corrick, Pascal Costanza, Andy Czerwonka, Martin Diehl, Daniel Drasin, Juan Gomez Duaso,
        Don Dwiggins, Peter Foreman, Russell Freeman, Peter Gassmann, Jason Gorman, Dan Green, Lars Gregori, Rick Hansen, Tobin Harris, Russel Healey,
        Christian Heller, Richard Henderson, Kyle Hermenean, Carsten Heyl, Akira Hirasawa, Eric Kaun, Kirk Knoernschild, Jesper Ladegaard, Chris Lopez,
        Paolo Marino, Jeremy Miller, Ivan Mitrovic, Thomas Neumann, Judy Obee, Paolo Parovel, Trevor Pinkney, Tomas Restrepo, Joel Rieder, Matthew Roberts, 
        Stefan Roock, Ken Rosha, Andy Schneider, Alexandre Semenov, Stan Silvert, Geoff Soutter, Volker Termath, Christopher Thames, Volker Turau, Knut Wannheden,
        Marc Wallace, Stefan Wenig, Brad Wiemerslage, Mark Windholtz, Michael Yoon.</p>
        <p>There are many others who gave input whose names I either never knew or can't remember, but my thanks is no less heartfelt.</p>
        <p>My biggest thanks is, as ever, to my wife Cindy, whose company I appreciate much more than anyone can appreciate this book.</p>
