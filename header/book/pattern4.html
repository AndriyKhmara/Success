                <h3>Execution Contexts</h3>
                    <p>Whenever processing occurs in a system, it occurs in some context and usually in more than one. There's no
                    standard terminology for execution contexts, so here we'll define the ones that we're assuming in this book.</p>
                    <p>From the perspective of interacting with the outside world, two important contexts are the request and the
                    session. A request corresponds to a single call from the outside world which the software works on and for
                    which it optionally sends back a response. During a request the processing is largely in the server's court and
                    the client is assumed to wait for a response. Some protocols allow the client to interrupt a request before it
                    gets a response, but this is fairly rare. More often a client may issue another request that may interfere with
                    one it just sent. So a client may ask to place an order and then issue a separate request to cancel that order.
                    From the client's view the two requests may be obviously connected, but depending on your protocol that
                    may not be so obvious to the server.</p>
                    <p>A session is a long-running interaction between a client and a server. It may consists of a single request,
                    but more commonly it consists of a series of requests that the user regards as a consistent logical sequence.
                    Commonly a session will begin with a user logging in and doing various bits of work that may involve issuing
                    queries and one or more business transactions (to be discussed shortly). At the end of the session the user
                    logs out, or he may just go away and assume that the system interprets that as logging out.</p>
                    <p>Server software in an enterprise application sees both requests and sessions from two angles, as the server
                    from the client and as the client to other systems. Thus, you'll often see multiple sessions: HTTP sessions
                    from the client and database sessions with various databases.</p>
                    <p>Two important terms from operating systems are processes and threads. A process is a, usually
                    heavyweight, execution context that provides a lot of isolation for the internal data it works on. A thread is
                    a lighter-weight active agent that's set up so that multiple threads can operate in a single process. People
                    like threads because they support multiple requests within a single process—which is good utilization of
                    resources. However, threads usually share memory, and such sharing leads to concurrency problems. Some
                    environments allow you to control what data a thread may access, allowing you to have isolated threads
                    that don't share memory.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty with execution contexts comes when they don't line up as well as we might like. In theory each
                    session would have an exclusive relationship with a process for its whole lifetime. Since processes are
                    properly isolated from each other, this would help reduce concurrency conflicts. Currently we don't know of
                    any server tools that allow you to work this way. A close alternative is to start a new process for each
                    request, which was the common mode for early Perl Web systems. People tend to avoid that now because
                    starting processes tie up a lot of resources, but it's quite common for systems to have a process handle only
                    one request at a time—and that can save many concurrency headaches.</p>
                    <p>When you're dealing with databases there's another important context—a transaction. Transactions pull
                    together several requests that the client wants treated as if they were a single request. They can occur from
                    the application to the database (a system transaction) or from the user to an application (a business
                    transaction). We'll dig into these terms more later on.</p>
