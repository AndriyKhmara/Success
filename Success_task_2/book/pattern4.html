			<h3>Execution Contexts</h3>
			<p>Whenever processing occurs in a system, it occurs in some context and usually in more than one. There's no
			standard terminology for execution contexts, so here we'll define the ones that we're assuming in this book.</p>
			<p>From the perspective of interacting with the outside world, two important contexts are the request and the
			session. A request corresponds to a single call from the outside world which the software works on and for
			which it optionally sends back a response. During a request the processing is largely in the server's court and
			the client is assumed to wait for a response. Some protocols allow the client to interrupt a request before it
			gets a response, but this is fairly rare. More often a client may issue another request that may interfere with
			one it just sent. So a client may ask to place an order and then issue a separate request to cancel that order.
			From the client's view the two requests may be obviously connected, but depending on your protocol that
			may not be so obvious to the server.</p>
			<p>A session is a long-running interaction between a client and a server. It may consists of a single request,
			but more commonly it consists of a series of requests that the user regards as a consistent logical sequence.
			Commonly a session will begin with a user logging in and doing various bits of work that may involve issuing
			queries and one or more business transactions (to be discussed shortly). At the end of the session the user
			logs out, or he may just go away and assume that the system interprets that as logging out.</p>
			<p>Server software in an enterprise application sees both requests and sessions from two angles, as the server
			from the client and as the client to other systems. Thus, you'll often see multiple sessions: HTTP sessions
			from the client and database sessions with various databases.</p>
			<p>Two important terms from operating systems are processes and threads. A process is a, usually
			heavyweight, execution context that provides a lot of isolation for the internal data it works on. A thread is
			a lighter-weight active agent that's set up so that multiple threads can operate in a single process. People
			like threads because they support multiple requests within a single process—which is good utilization of
			resources. However, threads usually share memory, and such sharing leads to concurrency problems. Some
			environments allow you to control what data a thread may access, allowing you to have isolated threads
			that don't share memory.</p>
			<p>The difficulty with execution contexts comes when they don't line up as well as we might like. In theory each
			session would have an exclusive relationship with a process for its whole lifetime. Since processes are
			properly isolated from each other, this would help reduce concurrency conflicts. Currently we don't know of
			any server tools that allow you to work this way. A close alternative is to start a new process for each
			request, which was the common mode for early Perl Web systems. People tend to avoid that now because
			starting processes tie up a lot of resources, but it's quite common for systems to have a process handle only
			one request at a time—and that can save many concurrency headaches.</p>
			<p>When you're dealing with databases there's another important context—a transaction. Transactions pull
			together several requests that the client wants treated as if they were a single request. They can occur from
			the application to the database (a system transaction) or from the user to an application (a business
			transaction). We'll dig into these terms more later on.</p>
