                <h3>Input Controller Patterns</h3>
                    <p>There are two patterns for the input controller. The most common is an input controller object for every page
                    on your Web site. In the simplest case this Page Controller can be a server page itself, combining the
                    roles of view and input controller. In many implementations it makes things easier to split the input
                    controller into a separate object. The input controller can then create appropriate models to do the
                    processing and instantiate a view to return the result. Often you'll find that there isn't quite a one-to-one
                    relationship between Page Controllers and views. A more precise thought is that you have a Page
                    Controller for each action, where an action is a button or link. Most of the time the actions correspond
                    to pages, but occasionally they don't—such as a link that may go to a couple of different pages depending
                    some condition.</p>
                    <p>With any input controller there are two responsibilities—handling the HTTP request and deciding what to do
                    with it—and it often makes sense to separate them. A server page can handle the request, delegating a
                    separate helper object to decide what to do with it. Front Controller goes further in this separation by
                    having only one object handling all requests. This single handler interprets the URL to figure out what kind of
                    request it's dealing with and creates a separate object to process it. In this way you can centralize all HTTP
                    handling within a single object, avoiding the need to reconfigure the Web server whenever you change the
                    action structure of the site.</p>
